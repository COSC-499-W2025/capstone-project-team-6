## Tasks Worked On 
- Assisted Mandira for the non-LLM analysis by analyzing OOP principles in Python code files.
- Created an unified analysis script to run both Mandira's and my scripts together for the analysis.
- Reviewed pull requests and provided insights for the same.
- Created unit tests for my code.
- Attended team meetings and assigned teammates to tasks. 
## Weekly Goals Recap 
- **Features I was responsible for (this milestone):** 
1. OOP Code analysis for python

All of my goals this week have been met successfully. I have created detailed analysis for python OOP principles and the program gives a comprehensive report ranking the user's ability to design and apply object oriented programming principles. This week was busy due to midterms, hence I created only one PR which is slightly fewer than the usual.

## Tasks Worked On  
- Researched the differences between local and cloud-based databases, comparing options like Supabase, PostgreSQL with pgvector, and other vector database alternatives.
- Refactored the vector database setup from Supabase (cloud) to a local pgvector instance using Docker Compose, finalizing the backend’s local embedding infrastructure.
- Updated `docker-compose.yml` to include a new `local_pgvector` service and ensured container-level database initialization worked through python -m backend.database_vector.
- Added fixtures and automated tests for vector database setup and document chunk embeddings.
- Integrated the local Ollama nomic-embed-text (768-dim) model to replace the JinaAI embedding model (which i also created).
- Verified end-to-end embedding generation, storage, and retrieval from the pgvector database.
- Reviewed teammate PRs, provided testing feedback, and helped resolve merge issues.
- Attended weekly meetings and coordinated backend integration tasks across the team.


## Weekly Goals Recap  
Transitioned to a fully local embedding setup and ensure backend database integration works end-to-end in Docker. The backend now supports offline embeddings using the Ollama model, ensuring faster performance and complete local control.
