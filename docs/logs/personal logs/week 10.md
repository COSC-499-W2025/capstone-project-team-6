## Weekly Goals Recap 
- **Features I was responsible for (this milestone):** 
1. OOP Code analysis for python

All of my goals this week have been met successfully. I have created detailed analysis for python OOP principles and the program gives a comprehensive report ranking the user's ability to design and apply object oriented programming principles. This week was busy due to midterms, hence I created only one PR which is slightly fewer than the usual. 


## PR's initiated
