## Tasks Worked On
- Created the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) for the project.  
- Updated the Data Flow Diagram (DFD) Level 1 with assistance from **Aakash**.  
- Ensured both the WBS and DFD reflected recent changes made to the project plan.  
- Assigned weekly tasks to team members and hosted meetings to coordinate progress.

## Weekly Goals Recap
The goal for this week was to refine the project documentation to align with our updated project direction.  
This included improving the accuracy and clarity of the WBS and DFD Level 1 to better represent the current system structure and workflow.  
Team coordination and meeting facilitation ensured that all updates were completed efficiently and aligned with team expectations.

## Tasks Worked On
- Created the docker file for the project and set up the initial project structure.
- Revised and understood how Docker containerization works and set up the local environment.
- Added issues into the Kanban board and assigned weekly tasks to team members.
- Attended team meetings to coordinate progress and assign tasks.

## Weekly Goals Recap
The goal for this week was to set up our local environments and create the foundation of our project. This included creating our docker file, and I tested it by running the project in two devices to check if the containerization works. Furthermore, after our discussion in the team meeting, I added the initial issues to be worked on in the Kanban board and this will be updated frequently going forward from the next sprint.
