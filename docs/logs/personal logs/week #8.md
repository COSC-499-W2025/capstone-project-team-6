## Tasks Worked On

- Completed the login and sign up authentication and connected everything to the backend.
- Created the command line interface and an interactive shell interface for testing.
- Linked the analysis on the CLI.
- Tested the features I have added.
- Assigned teammate's to tasks and conducted meetings.
- Tested other teammates code.

## Weekly Goals Recap

- **Features I was responsible for (this milestone):** Create command line interface and shell interface for the project and link everything merged so far.
- **Progress in the last 2 weeks:** Completed the login page, completed containerization work.

The goal for this week was to initially create a project dashboard, however I realized that the frontend is not needed for this milestone, hence I closed the PR associated with that. I then worked on the command line interface for the project and I linked everything done so far in this. Created the CLI prompts took a lot of time as it had several bugs and I had to go through python documentation as well. The CLI now works with login/sign up -> file analysis. The consent form and file upload will be linked to the CLI in the next sprint.

## Tasks Worked On

- Implemented ZIP file traversal functionality that analyzes compressed archives without extracting them to disk.
- Created file system abstraction layer with interfaces for both regular directories and ZIP archives using Python's `zipfile` module.
- Developed `Folder_traversal_fs()` function that automatically detects and handles both directory and ZIP file inputs.
- Updated `DirectoryNode` class to support both Path objects and string paths for unified handling.
- Created comprehensive test suite with 5 different test ZIP files covering various project structures (simple projects, monorepos, Python projects, non-projects, and mixed structures).
- Wrote automated tests using pytest with 11 test cases validating all ZIP traversal scenarios.
- Fixed critical bugs in subproject counting logic and path normalization for ZIP entries.
- Added extensive documentation including usage examples, API reference, and feature guide in `ZIP_TRAVERSAL_FEATURE.md`.
- Verified backward compatibility with existing `Folder_traversal()` function for regular directories.

## Weekly Goals Recap

- **Features I was responsible for (this milestone):** ZIP file traversal without extraction; file system abstraction layer; comprehensive testing and documentation.
