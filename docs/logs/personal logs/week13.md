## Weekly recap goals
- Extend Python OOP analysis and design-principles detection
- Refactor and improve résumé generation workflow
- Add resume-related database tables and caching functions
- Implement deletion workflow for previously generated insights
- Generate and test “Top Ranked Projects” feature
- Review teammates’ PRs
- Study for Quiz 2 and complete the quiz

## What went well
Over the past two weeks, I made strong progress across multiple core areas of the non-LLM pipeline. I expanded the Python OOP and design-principles detection, which strengthened the depth of our code-quality analysis. I also refactored the résumé generator to make the output more structured, scalable, and aligned with the new database schema.

Another major step forward was implementing new database tables and caching logic for analysis and résumé retrieval, which improves performance and supports persistent storage. I added full workflows for deleting previously generated insights and implemented (and tested) the “Top Ranked Projects” feature, including code-file filtering and scoring logic.

Overall, this sprint helped solidify several important subsystems: OOP analysis, résumé generation, caching, project ranking, and deletion workflows—all of which strengthened the reliability, usability, and maintainability of the pipeline. I also studied for and completed Quiz 2.

## What didn't go well
Due to time constraints, I couldn’t finish implementing retrieval for previously generated résumé items. This will be completed in the next sprint along with additional refinements after integrating the new caching logic. A few deeper tests for the new resume-retrieval pathways also need to be added..
