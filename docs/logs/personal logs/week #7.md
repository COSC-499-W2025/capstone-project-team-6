## Tasks Worked On

- Attended team meetings to discuss weekly goals, assign tasks, and resolve small issues related to our current sprint.
- Created and finalized the _consent page_ content for our application. The page explains how data is handled and gives users a clear choice between using local or cloud-based LLM processing.
- Conducted _research on LLMs (Large Language Models)_, including OpenAI, Llama Stack, and others, focusing on their privacy policies, data retention practices, and suitability for our project.
- Helped the team decide on the _best LLM_ to integrate into our app based on performance, privacy, and implementation feasibility.
- Reviewed the _DFD, **requirements, and **architecture diagram_ to prepare for the upcoming quiz and ensure a clear understanding of how each component connects.
- Reviewed and serviced _pull requests (PRs)_ from teammates, ensuring their code was consistent and properly integrated.
- Researched _Electron_, exploring its use in creating desktop applications and familiarising myself with its tech stack and how it connects to React and Node.js.
- Completed both _team_ and _personal logs_ for documentation and milestone tracking.

## Weekly Goals Recap

- This week was quite busy due to midterms, but I managed to complete all assigned tasks.
- The _consent page_ content was written correctly and ready for integration, though I initially created it in Markdown format instead of implementing it as an Electron interface. I’ll be updating it soon so that it displays automatically after login and before users upload files.
- I also spent extra time doing _in-depth research on LLMs_, which helped the team make informed decisions about model privacy and architecture design.
- Overall, despite time constraints, I balanced academics and project work effectively and made steady progress on both documentation and development tasks.

## Tasks Worked On

- Researched about Electron and React, and understanding how the packages and code structure works in electron in order to build efficiently.
- Continued working on docker containerization, fixing several bugs and errors.
- Automated running the docker file.
- Created a login page with login and signup functionality.
- Tested the features added this sprint.
- Assigned teammate's to tasks.
- Studied for the quiz held on Wednesday Oct 15.

## PR's initiated
- Login page draft funcitionality (#34)
- Added complete cross-platform docker containerization. (#30)

## PR's reviewed
- Set up SQLite environment with a test database
- Harjot week7logs

## Weekly Goals Recap

- **Features I was responsible for (this milestone):** Create user login/signup page, Complete docker containerization for MacOS and windows
- **Progress in the last 2 weeks:** Completed the login page, researched about react and electron and completed containerization work.

The goal for this week was to learn about react and electron and how it's linked to each other. I went through the documentation in detail in order to efficiently start working on the project. I continued working on Docker containerization and automation, however due to a lot of bugs and issues I could only automate the backend through Docker, and the frontend could only be done locally. This took atleast 4 hours to understand and fix. I created the login page with draft functionality, and the goal for next week is to create the complete functionality for the same once the database is created and finalized. Finally, I added unit tests to all my code, cleaned up the codebase and assigned my teammates to tasks. Overall, it was a really busy week and considering it was peak midterm season, it took a lot of time to work on the features assigned to me this week.
