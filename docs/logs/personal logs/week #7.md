## Tasks Worked On

- Researched about Electron and React, and understanding how the packages and code structure works in electron in order to build efficiently.
- Continued working on docker containerization, fixing several bugs and errors.
- Automated running the docker file.
- Created a login page with login and signup functionality.
- Tested the features added this sprint.
- Assigned teammate's to tasks.
- Studied for the quiz held on Wednesday Oct 15.

## Weekly Goals Recap

- **Features I was responsible for (this milestone):** Create user login/signup page, Complete docker containerization for MacOS and windows
- **Progress in the last 2 weeks:** Completed the login page, researched about react and electron and completed containerization work.

The goal for this week was to learn about react and electron and how it's linked to each other. I went through the documentation in detail in order to efficiently start working on the project. I continued working on Docker containerization and automation, however due to a lot of bugs and issues I could only automate the backend through Docker, and the frontend could only be done locally. This took atleast 4 hours to understand and fix. I created the login page with draft functionality, and the goal for next week is to create the complete functionality for the same once the database is created and finalized. Finally, I added unit tests to all my code, cleaned up the codebase and assigned my teammates to tasks. Overall, it was a really busy week and considering it was peak midterm season, it took a lot of time to work on the features assigned to me this week.
