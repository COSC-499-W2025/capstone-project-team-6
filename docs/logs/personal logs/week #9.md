## Tasks Worked On 
- Integrated the consent form to the CLI.
- Cleaned up the repository by moving files to folders for better organizations. 
- Added sessional management to the backend (currently for CLI and login, to be expanded further).
- Added more unit testing.
- Modified test structures such that a session is automatically logged in during testing. 
- Created a CI pipeline for the following:
1. Auto-merge a PR into `Development` after 2 approvals.
2. Linting verification and auto-formatting when linting errors are detected (for Python 3.14 only)
3. Unit testing of all backend tests (frontend will be added when frontend is being worked upon from the next term). 
## Weekly Goals Recap 
- **Features I was responsible for (this milestone):** 
1. Creation of a CI pipeline.
2. Creating and modifying any existing/missing unit tests.
3. Integrating the CLI to non-connected components. 

All of my goals this week have been met successfully. I have integrated the consent form to the CLI and added session management to the database. This way, existing users will not be required to keep providing consent, and only new users will be shown the consent form. Furthermore, a user can revoke consent at any time. The goal is to update the consent form in further iterations when more components are added (such as an LLM or any package). 

I have also successfully created the CI pipeline. This ensures that there will be no issues if a pull request is not merged into the `Development` branch due to someone forgetting to merge. Furthermore, the pipeline also checks for any linting issues, auto-formats the branch and runs unit tests everytime a PR is created. 

Through the creation of the pipeline and integration, the project will be much smoother to develop and run. It was a busy week so I was not able to work more on the analysis.
