## Weekly goals recap
- Write code for manual C analysis
- Write tests for manual C analysis
- Complete llama stack initialization
  
## What was completed
- Write code for manual C analysis
- Write tests for manual C analysis

## What didnt go as planned
During reading week while trying to complete the llama stack initialization, I ran into a bug in the llama stack source code which had an issue with docker. The docker image for llama stack didnt allow for embedding models to be tagged with the embedding parameter. Llama stack defaulted the parameter to llm eventhough it was clearly passed as an embedding model. This cause the llama stack route to completely be closed of. There for no working code could be provided and the branch was left locally due to the several errors that were displayed.

## Plan for next week
Get everything that we already have integrated into the CLI and work on having an output and demo that can be shown after next week. I have informed my teammates that i will not be available next week form Friday to Sunday and that i will do the work prior to then.

Study for test on Wednesday

Over the past two weeks, I made solid progress strengthening the non-LLM analysis pipeline. Building the Java OOP analysis helped me translate high-level design principles into practical code checks, and integrating it into the main pipeline showed me how each component contributes to the overall workflow.

Fixing bugs and adding project-size adaptations improved the accuracy and reliability of the analysis. Implementing database storage and résumé item generation also gave me a better sense of how our results will be used and how to present them meaningfully to users.

Overall, these weeks helped me improve both the technical quality of the analysis pipeline and my ability to think about how the system works end-to-end.## PR's initiated
