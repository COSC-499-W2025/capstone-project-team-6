Over the past two weeks, I made solid progress strengthening the non-LLM analysis pipeline. Building the Java OOP analysis helped me translate high-level design principles into practical code checks, and integrating it into the main pipeline showed me how each component contributes to the overall workflow.

Fixing bugs and adding project-size adaptations improved the accuracy and reliability of the analysis. Implementing database storage and résumé item generation also gave me a better sense of how our results will be used and how to present them meaningfully to users.

Overall, these weeks helped me improve both the technical quality of the analysis pipeline and my ability to think about how the system works end-to-end.## PR's initiated

## Tasks Worked On
- [x] Implemented the C++ OOP Analyzer for Phase 3
- [x] Wrote a full test suite for the analyzer
- [x] Added documentation for C++ analysis in Phase 3
- [x] Added libclang dependency and created a samplecpp.cpp test file
- [x] Debugged import issues, AST issues, and test failures
- [x] Prepared and opened PR #157 (C++ OOP Analyzer)

## Weekly Goals Recap
- [x] Finished the working version of the C++ OOP analysis module
- [x] Create a complete test suite 
- [x] Add the analyzer to the documentation & requirements

### What Was Accomplished
- [x] Implemented the entire C++ OOP analyzer using Clang’s AST
- [x] Created a comprehensive PyTest test suite
- [x] Added samplecpp.cpp so teammates can run real tests
- [x] Updated documentation:
Added “Phase 3: C++ OOP Detection” to MetadataExtractor README
Added installation & usage instructions
Added example output
Added known limitations section
- [x] Updated requirements.txt with libclang
- [x] Verified the analyzer works both when libclang is installed or missing (fallback mode)

### What Didn’t Go as Planned
- [x] libclang caused unexpected issues:
AST parsing fails silently if libclang is missing or incorrectly installed

- [x] Tests repeatedly failed until adjustments were made
- [x] Had to adjust imports to match the project structure.

### Looking Ahead
- [x] I plan to expand the detection system to include more patterns like Adapter, Decorator, and Bridge, while reducing false positives.
