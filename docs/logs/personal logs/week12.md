Over the past two weeks, I made solid progress strengthening the non-LLM analysis pipeline. Building the Java OOP analysis helped me translate high-level design principles into practical code checks, and integrating it into the main pipeline showed me how each component contributes to the overall workflow.

Fixing bugs and adding project-size adaptations improved the accuracy and reliability of the analysis. Implementing database storage and résumé item generation also gave me a better sense of how our results will be used and how to present them meaningfully to users.

Overall, these weeks helped me improve both the technical quality of the analysis pipeline and my ability to think about how the system works end-to-end.## PR's initiated
