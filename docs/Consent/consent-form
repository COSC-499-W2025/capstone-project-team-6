# Project Consent Form: Mining Digital Work Artifacts


## 1. Purpose of the Application

This application analyzes a **zipped project folder** that you provide to generate summaries, metrics, and résumé-ready highlights.  
With your consent, the app may optionally use an **external AI model (OpenAI API)** to enhance the quality of summaries.  
If you do **not** consent, the analysis will occur **locally** on your device using the **Llama Stack** (a locally hosted AI model) and deterministic methods.


## 2. Scope of Data Access

When you upload a ZIP file, the app will **only** access the contents within that ZIP. It will not scan or access files outside the uploaded folder.

The application may extract and process the following:

- File metadata (names, sizes, timestamps, types)  
- Readable text (e.g., README files, notes, documentation, comments)  
- Programming code (for classification and metrics)  
- Image metadata (for creative project context)


## 3. Optional External Processing (OpenAI API)

If you consent, the app may transmit limited text data to the **OpenAI API** for high-quality summarization.  

**Details:**
- **Provider:** OpenAI (API access only)  
- **Data Shared:** Short text excerpts (e.g., documentation, commit messages) and numerical metrics (e.g., file counts, dates). In some cases where further anlysis is required the entire file maybe shared with OpenAI.  
- **Purpose:** To generate project summaries and skill highlights.  
- **Data Retention:** OpenAI may retain inputs and outputs for up to **30 days** for abuse monitoring.  
  - Data is **not** used for model training.  
  - The app enables **Zero-Data-Retention (ZDR)** mode whenever available.


## 4. Local-Only Analysis (Llama Stack)

If you do not consent to external processing, the app performs all analysis locally using the **Llama Stack**, an open-source, privacy-preserving framework.

**Features of Local Mode:**
- Processes all data locally on your device.  
- Uses a locally hosted **Llama model** (via Ollama/vLLM).  
- Generates summaries using local templates and lightweight NLP.  

**Note:** This mode maximizes privacy but may produce less fluent summaries compared to the OpenAI-enhanced version.


## 5. Data Storage

Stored **locally** on your device:
- SQLite database with project metadata, metrics, summaries, and consent record.  
- Extracted text snippets (local use only).  
- Timestamped consent log.  

You can disable local logging of prompts/responses at any time.


## 6. Data Deletion

You may delete all stored data through **Settings → Privacy → Delete All Data**.  
This will remove all local databases, caches, and consent records.  
If OpenAI API was used, note that their **30-day retention period** cannot be shortened by this deletion.


## 7. Voluntary Participation

Your participation and data submission are voluntary.  
You may withdraw consent anytime via **Settings → Consent**, after which no further external data transmission will occur.

## 9. Consent Decision

Please select **one** of the following:

### A. Use OpenAI API (Cloud-Based)
- [ ] I consent to the app analyzing my uploaded ZIP and transmitting **limited text/code snippets** to the **OpenAI API** for improved summaries. I understand OpenAI may retain data for up to 30 days for security purposes and that Zero-Data-Retention mode is enabled when available.  

### B. Use Local Llama Stack (On-Device)
- [ ] I do **not** consent to external data transmission. The app will analyze my ZIP locally using the **Llama Stack**.  


### Developer Implementation Notes (Not Displayed to User)

- Display this form before accessing any uploaded files.  
- Store user choice as `{ useExternalAI: true/false }` in the consent table or JSON config.  
- Immediately halt any external API requests if consent is withdrawn.  
- Generate a **timestamped PDF “Consent Receipt”** containing this version and the user’s decision.
