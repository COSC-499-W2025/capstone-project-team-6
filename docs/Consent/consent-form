# Project Consent Form: Mining Digital Work Artifacts

## 1. Purpose of the Application

This application analyzes a **zipped project folder** that you provide to generate summaries, metrics, and résumé-ready highlights.  

All analysis is performed **locally on your device** using the **Llama Stack**, a privacy-preserving AI framework.  
No data is transmitted to any external server or third-party API.


## 2. Scope of Data Access

When you upload a ZIP file, the app will **only** access the contents within that ZIP.  
It will not scan or access any other files or directories on your device.

The application may extract and process the following:

- File metadata (names, sizes, timestamps, types)  
- Readable text (e.g., README files, notes, documentation, comments)  
- Programming code (for classification and metrics)  
- Image metadata (for creative project context)


## 3. Local Analysis (Llama Stack)

All data analysis occurs locally using the **Llama Stack**, which runs entirely on your device.  

**Features of Local Processing:**
- No internet connection is required for analysis.  
- All computations and model inferences are performed locally using **Llama models** (via Ollama/vLLM).  
- The model and its runtime environment are sandboxed to prevent unauthorized data access.  
- Summaries and metrics are generated using local templates and natural language generation tools.  

**Privacy Considerations:**
- Your data **never leaves your device**.  
- No external APIs or cloud-based services are contacted.  
- The model and system logs remain local and are not shared or synced automatically.  


## 4. Data Storage

Stored **locally** on your device:
- SQLite database containing project metadata, metrics, summaries, and your consent record.  
- Extracted text snippets used for local analysis only.  
- Timestamped consent log.  

You may disable local logging of prompts/responses at any time in **Settings → Privacy**.


## 5. Data Deletion

You may delete all stored data through **Settings → Privacy → Delete All Data**.  
This action removes:
- All local databases, caches, summaries, and consent records.  
- Any temporary extracted files or logs generated during processing.

Since no external data transmission occurs, deletion is immediate and complete.


## 6. Voluntary Participation

Your participation and data submission are voluntary.  
You may withdraw consent at any time through **Settings → Consent**, after which the application will cease all data analysis and delete existing data if requested.

## 8. Consent Decision

Please confirm the following:

- [ ] I consent to the app analyzing my uploaded ZIP **locally** using the **Llama Stack**.  
  I understand that no data will be transmitted externally, and all processing occurs on my device for maximum privacy.  


### Developer Implementation Notes (Not Displayed to User)

- Display this form before accessing any uploaded files.  
- Store user consent as `{ useExternalAI: false }` in the consent table or JSON config.  
- Ensure all AI analysis runs locally within the Llama Stack runtime.  
- Generate a **timestamped PDF “Consent Receipt”** containing this version and the user’s decision.
